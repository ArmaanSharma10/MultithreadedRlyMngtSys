# MultithreadedRlyMngtSys
This code is implementation of a multi-threaded seat reservation system to efficiently handle concurrent seat bookings in a high-demand environment.  
We utilize multithreading techniques to enable simultaneous processing of multiple reservation requests, optimizing system performance and response times.  
Note that you will need to unzip the Input.zip to take in sample inputs into the program, also the output folder is given to compare results of the previous iterations when the code was run.  
This project has been made as a part of the course CS301 (Databases) AY2022-23 under professor Viswwanath Gunthuri, contributors are Armaan Sharma and Tanish Goyal.
